## What Are Cornell Notes?

Developed by Professor Walter Pauk at Cornell University in the 1940s, the Cornell Note-taking System is a systematic format for condensing and organizing notes. This method has been proven to improve comprehension and retention of material.

## The Three-Section Layout

### 1. Cue Column (Left)
- 2.5 inches wide
- Contains questions, keywords, and main ideas
- Used for review and self-testing

### 2. Note-Taking Area (Right)
- 6 inches wide
- Main notes during lecture or reading
- Use telegraphic sentences and symbols

### 3. Summary Section (Bottom)
- 2 inches tall
- Summarize the entire page in 1-2 sentences
- Write within 24 hours of taking notes

## Why Cornell Notes Work

The system engages multiple cognitive processes:
- **Recording**: Active listening and processing
- **Reducing**: Identifying key concepts
- **Reciting**: Self-testing from cue column
- **Reflecting**: Creating connections
- **Reviewing**: Systematic revision

## Digital vs. Traditional Cornell Notes

While the traditional pen-and-paper method has benefits for memory encoding, digital Cornell Notes offer:
- Searchability
- Easy reorganization
- Multimedia integration
- Cloud backup
- Sharing capabilities

## Getting Started

1. Set up your page with the three sections
2. Take notes during class in the main area
3. Add cues and questions immediately after class
4. Write your summary within 24 hours
5. Review regularly using the cue column

The Cornell Notes system isn't just about taking notesâ€”it's about creating a comprehensive learning tool that serves you long after the lecture ends.
