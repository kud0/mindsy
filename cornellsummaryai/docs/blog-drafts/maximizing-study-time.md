## The Problem with Traditional Study Methods

Most students rely on passive reading and highlighting, techniques that research shows are among the least effective for long-term retention. Studies from cognitive psychology reveal that our brains need active engagement to form lasting memories.

## Evidence-Based Study Techniques

### 1. Active Recall
Instead of re-reading notes, test yourself regularly. This forces your brain to retrieve information, strengthening neural pathways.

### 2. Spaced Repetition
Review material at increasing intervals. This takes advantage of the spacing effect, a psychological phenomenon where information is better remembered when study sessions are spaced out.

### 3. The Feynman Technique
Explain concepts in simple terms as if teaching someone else. This reveals gaps in understanding and solidifies knowledge.

## Implementing These Techniques

Start by breaking your study material into chunks. For each chunk:
1. Study actively for 25 minutes (Pomodoro technique)
2. Take a 5-minute break
3. Test yourself on what you learned
4. Schedule review sessions for 1 day, 3 days, and 1 week later

## Measuring Your Progress

Keep a study journal to track:
- Topics covered
- Techniques used
- Self-test scores
- Areas needing review

By applying these scientific principles, you can transform your study sessions from passive consumption to active learning, dramatically improving your retention and understanding.
