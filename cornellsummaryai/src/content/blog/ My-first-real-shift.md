I’m studying to become a personal trainer, and I also happen to code. Looks cool on a bio, but in class it exposed a very specific gap: I learn fast, and I’m terrible at taking notes. When I joined FitGeneration.es, I’d watch the video classes, understand the ideas… and the moment I tried to write, chaos. My brain was at 200, my hand at 30. End result: half sentences, scattered concepts, and that feeling when you sit down to review and the thread just isn’t there.

Then I noticed something simple: the platform shares MP3s of the classes. Instead of fighting to capture everything live, I could listen back calmly and pull out the important bits. Around then I found the Cornell method—cue column on the left, clear notes in the middle, short summary at the bottom—and it clicked right away. I didn’t need more hours; I needed structure.

That’s where MySummary.app comes from.

## What I actually needed

- Turn a class into solid notes in minutes—not lose an afternoon.
- Keep a consistent structure so review doesn’t feel like starting from zero.
- Include exam-style questions so I know if I’m ready, not just hopeful.


## What MySummary.app does (no fluff)

- Upload your class recording and get Cornell-style notes + a short, clear summary.
- Auto-generates exam-style questions so you practice real recall (not just skim and nod).
- One simple flow: from audio to “study-ready” in a single pass.

Today—August 8, 2025—I’m launching version one. I’m using it in my own classes, and I’ll keep tuning it based on what I learn.

## Why not just use a generic AI chat?

I tried. Two big blockers:

- Long lectures often blow past upload limits on general tools.
- I don’t want “a summary.” I want notes that look like a study guide every time: same structure (cues, notes, summary) and questions that make me think. That last stretch is what actually moves the needle when you study.


## How I use it (feel free to steal this)

- After class, I upload the MP3.
- First pass: skim the cue column (key terms and questions).
- Second: read the summary to make sure the lecture has a clear “start to finish” in my head.
- Third: answer the exam-style questions and mark what’s weak.

It takes me about 15–20 minutes per class, and for the first time I feel prepared without rewriting everything.

## What I’m building next

- A dashboard to keep subjects and modules tidy and see what’s due for review.
- Bring in handwritten notes (photo/scan) and export as clean, well-formatted PDFs.
- Smarter study loops: tags, cross-lecture links, and spaced-repetition decks built from your generated questions.
- Student-friendly pricing: clear, fair, and with a genuinely useful free start.

If your brain moves faster than your pen, this is for you.

## I’d love your feedback (for real)

- Which exports matter most: PDF, Notion, Anki?
- Do you prefer tougher or gentler questions by default?
- Should I add group study features, or keep it simple and fast?

I’m building this for real students, not a pretty landing page. If you try it and it doesn’t help, tell me why. If it saves you time, tell me what to double down on.

P.S. If your course shares MP3s (like mine), this workflow is a game-changer. If not, always ask before recording—and let structure do the heavy lifting.
