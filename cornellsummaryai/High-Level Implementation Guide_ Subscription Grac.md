# High-Level Implementation Guide: Subscription Grace Period Feature

## Architecture Overview

**Objective**: Implement subscription downgrade with grace periods where users maintain current tier benefits until their billing cycle ends, then automatically transition to the lower tier.

## Core Components \& Responsibilities

### 1. Database Layer

**Purpose**: Store subscription state and track grace periods

- Design subscription table with dual-tier concept (`current_tier` vs `effective_tier`)
- Add grace period tracking fields (`cancel_at_period_end`, `current_period_end`)
- Create audit trail for subscription changes
- Implement proper indexes and Row Level Security


### 2. Permission System

**Purpose**: Determine user access rights based on grace period status

- Function to calculate effective tier based on current time vs billing period
- Feature access checker that uses effective tier
- Real-time grace period validation
- Automatic tier updates when grace periods expire


### 3. Stripe Integration

**Purpose**: Manage subscription lifecycle with Stripe

- Use Stripe's `cancel_at_period_end` instead of immediate cancellation
- Sync Stripe webhook events with local database
- Handle subscription reactivation during grace periods
- Maintain billing accuracy throughout the process


### 4. API Layer

**Purpose**: Provide endpoints for subscription management

- Subscription status endpoint (returns current permissions and grace period info)
- Downgrade endpoint (schedules downgrade via Stripe)
- Reactivation endpoint (cancels scheduled downgrade)
- Proper error handling and validation


### 5. User Interface

**Purpose**: Clear communication of subscription status

- Show current tier and grace period status
- Display countdown/expiration dates
- Provide reactivation options during grace period
- Confirmation dialogs for subscription changes


### 6. Background Processing

**Purpose**: Maintain data consistency over time

- Cleanup job for expired grace periods
- Webhook processing for Stripe events
- Data synchronization between systems
- Monitoring and alerting


## Key Business Rules

1. **Grace Period Logic**: When user downgrades, they keep current benefits until billing period ends
2. **Reactivation Window**: Users can cancel the downgrade anytime before grace period expires
3. **Automatic Transition**: System automatically moves users to new tier when grace period ends
4. **Billing Integrity**: No immediate refunds, users get full value of their paid period
5. **Data Consistency**: All systems (Stripe, Supabase, UI) must reflect the same state

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Database schema and basic permission logic
- Core Stripe integration functions
- Basic API endpoints


### Phase 2: User Experience

- Frontend components for subscription management
- Grace period notifications and UI
- Confirmation workflows


### Phase 3: Automation

- Webhook processing
- Background cleanup jobs
- Monitoring and error handling


## Technical Decisions for Claude Code

**Database**: Use Supabase with proper RLS policies
**State Management**: Dual-tier approach (current vs effective)
**Grace Period Calculation**: Server-side time comparisons
**Stripe Strategy**: Use `cancel_at_period_end` flag
**Frontend Framework**: Astro with progressive enhancement
**Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user feedback

## Success Criteria

- Zero immediate feature loss when users downgrade
- 100% accurate grace period calculations
- Seamless reactivation during grace periods
- Data consistency between all systems
- Clear user communication throughout the process

**Instructions for Claude Code**: Implement each component following modern best practices, ensuring proper error handling, security, and user experience. Focus on maintainable, testable code that handles edge cases gracefully.
